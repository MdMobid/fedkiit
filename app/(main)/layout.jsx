/**
 * Main site layout — the `MainLayout` component from App.jsx.
 *
 * Same structure: Navbar, a `.page` wrapper that gains `.omega-page` on the
 * Omega route, then Footer.
 *
 * The Chatbot is *not* here. App.jsx renders it above `<Routes>`, so it appears
 * on every route including Login, SignUp and the OTP screens; mounting it in
 * this layout hid it on all of those. It now lives in the root layout.
 *
 * Deliberately no Suspense boundary here. Wrapping `{children}` made every
 * Prerendered page ship its content twice — once inside the streamed boundary
 * (`div#S:0`) and once outside — so the Home sections appeared duplicated in the
 * DOM. Only the handful of pages that call `useSearchParams()` need a boundary,
 * and they each declare their own.

  // .page and main — which is what put the headings on /Team, /Alumni and
  // /profile underneath the navbar.

  // run up behind a transparent navbar, and an offset there would leave a band
